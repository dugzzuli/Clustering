Title: Multi-View Clustering via Concept Factorization with Local Manifold Regularization (MVCC)
--------------------------------------------------------------

The project deals with multi-view clustering problem. The work has been accepted by IEEE ICDM 2016. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. (Email: hwang@my.swjtu.edu.cn)

To run the MVCC algorithm you can simply execute the script: run_MVCC.m

The details of the main folders are given below,
- Datasets: Contains various datasets used for testing the models.
- run_MVCC: Startup for some examples. Here, you can choose the dataset and set the number of iterations.
- MVCC    : Conatins implementation of MVCC.
- bestmap : permute labels of L2 match L1 as good as possible.
- CalcMeasures: get the clustering performance results, including ACC, NMI and F-measures.
