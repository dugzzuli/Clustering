Temporary Title: Multi-View Clustering via Concept Factorization with Local Manifold Regularization (MVCC)
--------------------------------------------------------------

The project deals with multi-view clustering problem. As the manuscript is under triple blind review now, we release the project in the anonymous way. Further details will be available at a later time.

To run the MVCC algorithm you can simply execute the script: run_MVCC.m

The details of the main folders are given below,
- Datasets: Contains various datasets used for testing the models.
- MVCC    : Conatins implementation of MVCC.

Note that: we thanks to relevant researchers, who share their codes. And, the copyright belongs to them.
